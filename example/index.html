            "blurb": "The 2011 Oakland A\'s offense was, in a word, inept. As a team, the Athletics hit .244/.311/.369. They finished 20th in runs scored and 24th in home runs. Just one player on the entire roster hit higher than .265 that season: Jemile Weeks, the team\'s primary second baseman, who managed just two homers all year. On the final day of the 2011 season, with the A\'s out of contention, the Mariners let Oakland hitters stand on the outfield grass for all their at-bats; not a single player reached the warning track.\n\nOK, that last part\'s not true. But the rest is. Even adjusting for the offense-suppressing, home-run-squashing confines of O.co Coliseum, the A's still stunk, posting the 23rd-ranked offense in the majors, one that was 11 percent worse than league average.\n\nWhich is what makes what's happened since a minor miracle. The 2012 A's hit 195 home runs, the seventh-highest total in the majors last year and a 71 percent jump from the year before. Five players hit 15 or more homers last season, up from just one in 2011. All told, the A's offense surged to 10th-best in the game on a park- and league-adjusted basis. This year, Oakland's attack has taken another step forward: Twenty-one games in, the A's are scoring 5.7 runs per game, the best mark in baseball.",
